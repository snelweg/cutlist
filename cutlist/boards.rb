# description of boards which may be used.
# It manages getting a board closest to your specification either inventing one ( ordering it
# presumable from some sustainably managed pool of electronic boards) or getting one out
# of the warehouse ( which the user has obviously obtained from a sustainable source)
# Boards may be returned for a different size if it didn't suit and substituted for another one

# class LayoutBoard - boards used in the layout - maintains a list of parts
# which are to be cut from this board and the data structure representing 
# used and unused portions of the board.
# Note that this view of the board is specific to this layout algorithm. 
# Other algorithms may need a different LayoutBoardClass
# This is a tree structure. Whenever a part is cut out of the board, the
# remaining area can be represented by two rectangles - two in the horizontal direction
# and two in the vertical direction covering all of the remaining unused space. 
# These two views represent all options for future placement
# and are represented as left and right branches of a tree structure.
# When we go to place the next part, we choose the best option by determining which fills one of
# available spaces the best. When that choice is selected, then we eliminate from the tree the 
# options which are no longer available
# For example, let's say we have a 4x8 sheet of plywood. Place the sheet horizontally.
# if we need a piece cut out 2'x3', then horizontal remaining spaces are 2x5,2x8 ( =10+16=26 sq ft)
# vertical remaining spaces are 3x2 and 5x4 ( =6+20=26bdft)
# As soon as we select one of the 4 choices for the next part, that selects that pair and the pair not chosen
# is immediately eliminated from further choices. Then the part that is placed subdivides the space that we chose
# with 4 options and so on.
# Whenever we go to place a part we explore all available options for one that fits the best ie: with the least amount of waste
# we do this by comparing sq ft of the part to be placed with the sq ft of the available space.
